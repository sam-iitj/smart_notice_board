HI this is my project for smart notice board . For system on chip lab .


There are basically two files in this project :

1 allin_one_window.py
2 server.py

One of them will run on the client side and other on the server side 

1)you also need to install nfs file system and make an index.txt file in that nfs file system.
2)you also need to make file table.txt for storing all the data you download from the email.
